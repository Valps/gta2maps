----------------------

Pick a car and enter the arena. Survive!

You cannot exit your car whatsoever. Just use the car weapons to win the round.

After a round finish, another will start in some seconds.

Cars available:
- Bus	  (No collide, but Heavy Mass & strength to compensate the self-damage)
- Firetruck  (firethrower)
- Rumble     (Average car)
- GT-A1	  (more fragile, but fast)

A health powerup will appear at the centre of the arena. The first player to get it will repair their car.

It's a prototype, so changes may occur in the future. Go to the gtamp forum to give your suggestions.

Have fun!
